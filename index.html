            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Nicolas Leo Moreira. My journey has been an exciting blend of competitive swimming, dedicated volunteering, and a passion for various hobbies. As a former competitive swimmer, I've developed discipline and resilience, traits that have powered my volunteering endeavors and professional pursuits. I'm an avid football fan, staunchly supporting Atletico Mineiro, and I find relaxation in hiking and building intricate Lego models. These experiences have shaped my approach to life, blending a competitive spirit with a love for creativity and community service.</p>
